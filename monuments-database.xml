                Colosseum is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy.
                Built of travertine, tuff, and brick-faced concrete, it is the largest amphitheatre ever built.
                The Colosseum is situated just east of the Roman Forum.
                Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in AD 72, and was completed in AD 80 under his successor
                and heir Titus.
                Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian.
                These three emperors are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named in Latin for its
                association with their family name (Flavius).

                Berlin Wall was a guarded concrete barrier that physically and ideologically divided Berlin from 1961 to
                1989.
                Constructed by the German Democratic Republic, starting on 13 August 1961,
                the Wall cut off West Berlin from virtually all of surrounding East Germany and East Berlin until
                government officials opened it in November 1989.
                Its demolition officially began on 13 June 1990 and finished in 1992.
                The barrier included guard towers placed along large concrete walls, accompanied by a wide area that
                contained anti-vehicle trenches, "fakir beds" and other defenses.
                The Eastern Bloc portrayed the Wall as protecting its population from fascist elements conspiring to
                prevent the "will of the people" in building a socialist state in East Germany.

            <history>
                Notre-Dame de Paris is a medieval Catholic cathedral on the √éle de la Cit√© in the fourth arrondissement
                of Paris, France.
                The cathedral is widely considered to be one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture.
                The innovative use of the rib vault and flying buttress, the enormous and colorful rose windows,
                and the naturalism and abundance of its sculptural decoration all set it apart from earlier Romanesque
                architecture.

                Big Ben is the nickname for the Great Bell of the clock at the north end of the Palace of Westminster in
                London and is usually extended to refer to both
                the clock and the clock tower. The official name of the tower in which Big Ben is located was originally
                the Clock Tower,
                but it was renamed Elizabeth Tower in 2012 to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II.

                Palace of Culture and Science is a notable high-rise building in Warsaw, Poland. Constructed in 1955, it
                is the center for various companies,
                public institutions and cultural activities such as concerts, cinemas, theaters,
                libraries, sports clubs, universities, scientific institutions and authorities of the Polish Academy of
                Sciences.
                Motivated by Polish historicism and American art deco high-rise buildings,
                the PKiN was designed by Soviet architect Lev Rudnev in "Seven Sisters" style and is informally referred
                to as the Eighth Sister.
