                Colosseum is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy.
                Built of travertine, tuff, and brick-faced concrete, it is the largest amphitheatre ever built.
                The Colosseum is situated just east of the Roman Forum.
                Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in AD 72, and was completed in AD 80 under his successor
                and heir Titus.
                Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian.
                These three emperors are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named in Latin for its
                association with their family name (Flavius).

                Berlin Wall was a guarded concrete barrier that physically and ideologically divided Berlin from 1961 to
                1989.
                Constructed by the German Democratic Republic, starting on 13 August 1961,
                the Wall cut off West Berlin from virtually all of surrounding East Germany and East Berlin until
                government officials opened it in November 1989.
                Its demolition officially began on 13 June 1990 and finished in 1992.
                The barrier included guard towers placed along large concrete walls, accompanied by a wide area that
                contained anti-vehicle trenches, "fakir beds" and other defenses.
                The Eastern Bloc portrayed the Wall as protecting its population from fascist elements conspiring to
                prevent the "will of the people" in building a socialist state in East Germany.

                Notre-Dame de Paris is a medieval Catholic cathedral on the Île de la Cité in the fourth arrondissement
                of Paris, France.
                The cathedral is widely considered to be one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture.
                The innovative use of the rib vault and flying buttress, the enormous and colorful rose windows,
                and the naturalism and abundance of its sculptural decoration all set it apart from earlier Romanesque
                architecture.

                Big Ben is the nickname for the Great Bell of the clock at the north end of the Palace of Westminster in
                London and is usually extended to refer to both
                the clock and the clock tower. The official name of the tower in which Big Ben is located was originally
                the Clock Tower,
                but it was renamed Elizabeth Tower in 2012 to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II.

                According to the National Park Service, the idea for the Statue of Liberty was first proposed by Édouard
                René de Laboulaye,
                president of the French Anti-Slavery Society and a prominent and important political thinker of his
                time.
                The project is traced to a mid-1865 conversation between de Laboulaye, a staunch abolitionist, and
                Frédéric Bartholdi, a sculptor.

                Vincentian priest, Pedro Maria Boss, first suggested placing a Christian monument on Mount Corcovado in
                the mid 1850s to honor Princess Isabel,
                princess regent of Brazil and the daughter of Emperor Pedro II, but the project was not approved. In
                1889 the country became a republic,
                and due to the separation of church and state, the proposed statue was dismissed.

                The first mason to receive an offer to complete the project was Jakub Kordes from Lubeka, but for
                unknown reasons his plan was not accepted.
                The new fountain was to be constructed at the centre of the facade of the Artus Court, from the Green
