            Colosseum is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy.
            Built of travertine, tuff, and brick-faced concrete, it is the largest amphitheatre ever built. 
            The Colosseum is situated just east of the Roman Forum. 
            Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in AD 72, and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir Titus.
            Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian. 
            These three emperors are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named in Latin for its association with their family name (Flavius).

            Berlin Wall was a guarded concrete barrier that physically and ideologically divided Berlin from 1961 to 1989.
            Constructed by the German Democratic Republic, starting on 13 August 1961, 
            the Wall cut off West Berlin from virtually all of surrounding East Germany and East Berlin until government officials opened it in November 1989.
            Its demolition officially began on 13 June 1990 and finished in 1992.
            The barrier included guard towers placed along large concrete walls, accompanied by a wide area that contained anti-vehicle trenches, "fakir beds" and other defenses. 
            The Eastern Bloc portrayed the Wall as protecting its population from fascist elements conspiring to prevent the "will of the people" in building a socialist state in East Germany.
